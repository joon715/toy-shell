<Upgrade list>
1. I upgraded the command-line prompt showing user, host.
-> Colored the "user" green, colored the host "blue"
-> Refered to the code from gethostusername.c that the professor gave.

2. I upgraded the Myshell to closed by "exit" command
-> Using string function strcmp(char *s1, char *s2) to compare args[0] and "exit" literal.
-> When Myshell is closed, it prints "Myshell is closed" message on terminal.
